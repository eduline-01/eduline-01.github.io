      <li><p>Exploring swimming at low Reynolds number; various frameworks for modelling flagellar swimming of microorganisms, namely, Taylor’s swimming sheet and slender body theory; ciliary propulsion using Lamb’s general solution and reciprocal theorem; mathematical framework necessary for the far-field description of a swimmer using Stokeslet and Stokes dipole; hydrodynamic interactions near a boundary: lubrication theory, far-field approximation, and flagellar synchronization; effects of elasticity on inertialess locomotion using slender body theory and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory; elasticity in the fluid medium and its impact on locomotion using Oldroyd-B model; and the design and analysis of synthetic microswimmers.</p></li>
      <li><p>Numerically implementing the above mathematical frameworks and models in MATLAB to replicate some of the results already available in the literature.</p></li>
      <li><p>The goal is to explore and analyse the trajectories of one or more microorganisms interacting pairwise near a flat wall inside a three-dimensional channel using Lattice Boltzmann simulations.</p></li>

     <b>Topic:</b> Non-linear Stability Analysis of Fluid Flows Using Polynomial Sum of Squares.

      <li><p>Exploring analytical methods for proving upper and lower bounds on infinite-time averages in deterministic dynamical systems and on stationary expectations in stochastic systems. The dynamics and the quantities to be bounded are assumed to be polynomial functions of the state variables. The methods are computer-assisted, using sum-of-squares (SoS) polynomials to formulate sufficient conditions that can be checked by semidefinite programming (SDP).</p></li>
      <li><p>Determining deterministic and stochastic bounds for the van der Pol oscillator by numerically implementing the above methods in MATLAB using YALMIP. Further, carrying out numerical analysis to explain the determined bounds.</p></li>
      <li><p>The stability analysis of fluid flows, typically modelled by nonlinear PDEs, is of fundamental importance for understanding unsteadiness and turbulence as well as proposing active flow control algorithms. In 2012, P. Goulart and S. Chernyshenko published a paper titled <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.1043.pdf">Global Stability Analysis of Fluid Flows using Sum-of-Squares</a>, where they described a new method for stability analysis and control of fluid flows, based on a recent progress in the application of Sum of Squares of polynomials and semideﬁnite programming in combination with a Lyapunov-based approach to stability analysis and design. Using this method, non-linear stability of fluid flows have been established for values of Reynolds number about seven times larger than the largest value for which non-linear stability can be established by the standard energy stability approach. The goal is to examine if this method can be used to establish non-linear stability of fluid flows for values of Reynolds number beyond the above limit.</p></li>
